# act

`act` is a command-line tool to manage custom Python scripts.

## SYNOPSIS

    act <command> [options] [arguments]

## EXAMPLES

Installs a script from the /community-scripts directory:


```shell
$ act install weather
'weather' is a community script by janoelze.
It may access the internet, read and write files, and use third party libraries.
Are you sure you want to install this script? [y/N]: y
Community script 'weather' installed successfully.
Successfully recreated shims for 2 scripts in '/Users/janoelze/.act/bin'.
```

Runs the script with the city argument:

$ act run weather --city Berlin
