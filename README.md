# ACT

`act` is a command-line tool to manage custom Python scripts.

## WHY

I really love how `uv` allows users to [define dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies) inline with their python code. `act` takes this idea and extends the script header with a `command` property and then allows global calls to these scripts by their command name. Additionally shims are created for each script in the `~/.act/bin` directory, allowing you to run the scripts directly from the terminal.

## SYNOPSIS

    act <command> [options] [arguments]

## USAGE

Installs a script from the [community-scripts](https://github.com/janoelze/act/tree/main/community-scripts) directory:


```shell
$ act install weather
'weather' is a community script by janoelze.
It may access the internet, read and write files, and use third party libraries.
Are you sure you want to install this script? [y/N]: y
Community script 'weather' installed successfully.
Successfully recreated shims for 2 scripts in '/Users/janoelze/.act/bin'.
```

Runs the script with the city argument:

```shell
# Runs the weather script with the city argument
$ act run weather --city Berlin
Berlin: ðŸŒ¨  +2Â°C
Done in 0.50s.
```

Orâ€”if you've added the ~/.act/bin directory to your PATHâ€”you can run the script directly:

```shell
# Runs the weather script with the city argument
$ weather --city Berlin
Berlin: ðŸŒ¨  +2Â°
Done in 0.50s.
```

## INSTALLATION

You can install or update act by running the following command in your terminal:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janoelze/act/main/install.sh | sh
```

Uninstall act by running the following command:

```shell
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/janoelze/act/main/uninstall.sh | sh
```

## SCRIPT ANATOMY

The script header contains metadata that describes the script's behavior and dependencies.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
# /// script
# command = "helloworld"
# description = "Hello, world!"
# aliases = ["hw"]
# author = "janoelze"
# dependencies = []
# ///

import os

def main():
    print("Hello, world!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Aliases are alternative names for the script that can be used to run it.

```shell
$ act run hw
Hello, world!
```
